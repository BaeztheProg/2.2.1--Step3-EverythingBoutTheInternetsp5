        <h2>The History</h2>
        <p>The internet was created in the late 1960s by the U.S. Department of Defense’s ARPA through the development of ARPANET. The project was led by Bob Taylor, with contributions from researchers like Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, who later developed key protocols. The first successful connection was made in 1969 between four universities.</p>
        <p>It was created primarily for military purposes, including the establishment of a secure communication network during the Cold War. The goal was to develop a decentralized system that could withstand attacks and maintain communication across military and government channels. Additionally, it was designed to allow researchers at universities and government institutions to easily share information and collaborate on projects, streamlining communication in the academic and scientific communities..</p>
